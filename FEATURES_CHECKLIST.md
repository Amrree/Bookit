# Features Implementation Checklist

This document tracks the implementation of all features requested in the original prompt for the Non-Fiction Book-Writing System.

## 1. Purpose ✅
- [x] Implement a system that can generate entire non-fiction books chapter-by-chapter from a user prompt
- [x] Ingest and learn from user references (PDF, MD, TXT, DOCX, EPUB)
- [x] Use research + writer + editor agents to produce, revise, and export books

## 2. Autonomous Research and Tech Selection ✅
- [x] Conduct autonomous web research to select concrete libraries/tools
- [x] Vector store / retrieval engine (ChromaDB chosen with justification)
- [x] Embedding models/providers (SentenceTransformers local + OpenAI remote with justification)
- [x] LLM backends/adapters (Ollama local + OpenAI remote with justification)
- [x] GUI framework candidate list and final choice (Streamlit chosen, deferred implementation)
- [x] CLI tooling candidate list and final choice (Click chosen with justification)
- [x] Concurrency/orchestration approach candidate list and final choice (AsyncIO chosen with justification)
- [x] Produce research document (research/RESEARCH.md) with citations/links and tradeoff analysis

## 3. Canonical Repositories Research & Cannibalization ✅
- [x] Find and analyze 5 public repositories for long-form writing with RAG
- [x] Find and analyze 5 public repositories for multi-agent orchestration with tool use
- [x] For each repository include URL, architecture summary, design patterns to cannibalize
- [x] Specify where patterns will be adapted in this project
- [x] Produce research/REPOS.md with full analyses
- [x] In-code comments reference which repository & file/class patterns came from

## 4. Project Layout and Modularity ✅

- [x] memory_manager — vector store integration, persistence, tagging, provenance metadata
- [x] llm_client — provider adapters with clear selection mechanism
- [x] tool_manager — MCP-style registry, sandboxing policy, safe execution, logging
- [x] agent_manager — task routing, concurrency, lifecycle, audit logs
- [x] research_agent — autonomous research and structured summaries
- [x] writer_agent — RAG-driven drafting, chapter generation
- [x] editor_agent — revision and consistency passes
- [x] tool_agent — executes registered tools under ToolManager
- [x] book_builder — outline management, chapter orchestration, export to Markdown/DOCX/PDF, bibliography
- [x] gui — placeholder module (Streamlit implementation provided)
- [x] cli — full CLI mirroring core capabilities
- [x] tests — unit and integration tests with fixtures
- [x] research — RESEARCH.md and REPOS.md from sections 2–3
- [x] run.py or scripts/run that can start CLI or GUI entrypoint

## 5. RAG, Memory, and Provenance ✅
- [x] Implement real RAG pipeline: ingest → chunk → embed → store → retrieve → context assembly → LLM call → response
- [x] Justify and document embedding model, vector store, chunking heuristics, persistence details
- [x] Define metadata model for memory entries with source_id, chunk_id, original_filename, ingestion_timestamp, agent_id, provenance_notes, tags, retrieval_score
- [x] Persist provenance alongside vectors and in human-readable provenance log file
- [x] Define concrete retrieval scoring and context-length management strategy
- [x] Define how inline citations will be produced in drafts (format, chunk id inclusion, bibliography mapping)

## 6. MCP (Model Control Protocol) and Tool Safety ✅
- [x] Define MCP protocol in documents and implement ToolManager to follow it
- [x] Agents send structured tool requests (tool_name, args, request_id, agent_id)
- [x] ToolManager validates (policy/sandbox), executes, returns structured responses
- [x] All calls logged with timestamps and agent identity
- [x] Configurable safety model (tool categories: safe, restricted, unsafe)
- [x] Default settings (restricted/unsafe disabled by default)
- [x] Explicit user actions required to enable restricted/unsafe tools
- [x] Implement sandboxing/timeouts/resource limits and document sandbox plan

## 7. Agent Orchestration and Workflows ✅
- [x] Explicit workflow sequences for ResearchAgent → WriterAgent → EditorAgent for one chapter cycle
- [x] Include required retrievals, memory writes, tool calls, approvals, transitions
- [x] Specify which modules invoked at each step and memory operations performed
- [x] Choose and document task execution model (AsyncIO with rationale)
- [x] Implement detailed logging/audit trail structure for agents and tool use

## 8. Exports, Bibliography, and Build Logs ✅
- [x] Implement book export to Markdown, DOCX, PDF with inline citations
- [x] Inline citations reference chunk ids and generated bibliography mapped to document metadata
- [x] Provide algorithm for building bibliography from used memory entries
- [x] Produce machine-readable build log for each book build recording: build_id, start/end timestamps, agents involved, tasks performed, chapters produced, source chunk ids used for each chapter, retrieval scores, tool invocations

## 9. Tests and CI ✅
- [x] Include tests/ suite with unit tests for each module boundary
- [x] Integration test covering: ingest small fixture doc → embed/store → retrieve → WriterAgent produces short chapter → EditorAgent revises → book export
- [x] Provide test fixtures in tests/fixtures/
- [x] Provide simple CI script or CI steps in README (scripts/run_tests.sh)

## 10. Implementation Rules for Generated Code ✅
- [x] Do not hard-code library choices; make them result of autonomous research
- [x] Document choices in research/RESEARCH.md and README
- [x] Top-of-file comments in each main module name chosen libraries and justify them briefly
- [x] All secrets/keys read from clear environment variables (document exact names in README)
- [x] Do not hard-code API keys or endpoints
- [x] Provide requirements.txt and pyproject.toml with precise macOS installation notes
- [x] All agent actions, retrievals, and tool uses logged to disk with timestamps for auditability
- [x] Provide docstrings, unit-testable APIs, and extensibility guide

## 11. Repository Output Format ✅
- [x] Complete repository presented as file blocks
- [x] Each file presented as: File: path/to/file.ext with full file contents
- [x] One code block per file
- [x] No additional text before, between, or after file blocks
- [x] Repository complete and self-contained (subject to installing declared dependencies and providing API credentials)
- [x] Include research/RESEARCH.md and research/REPOS.md with required research and 10 repository analyses
- [x] Code runnable on macOS after following README installation steps and setting required environment variables

## 12. Mandatory Deliverable Behavior ✅
- [x] Implemented code performs real ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and LLM calls via selected adapters
- [x] System persists memory to disk and updates memory immediately on ingestion and when agents write summaries/notes
- [x] Delivered repository clearly indicates where patterns were adapted from each of 10 researched repos (inline comments with URL + path)

## 13. Output Constraints ✅
- [x] Output only repository file blocks and nothing else
- [x] No preface, no explanations, no apologies, no extra analysis
- [x] If any file is large, still include it fully within its file block
- [x] If third-party licenses must be included, include them in LICENSES/ folder with files named after source repo and include brief attributions in research/REPOS.md

## 14. Environment Variables ✅
- [x] LLM_REMOTE_API_KEY
- [x] OLLAMA_LOCAL_URL (if Ollama endpoint chosen)
- [x] EMBEDDING_API_KEY (if remote embedding provider used)
- [x] VECTOR_DB_PATH (path to persistent vector DB)
- [x] TOOL_MANAGER_ALLOW_UNSAFE (boolean switch to enable unsafe tools; default false)
- [x] Include these names in README

## 15. Final Instruction ✅
- [x] After research and selection, implement repository in Python following all rules
- [x] Output final repository as file blocks exactly in format specified in section 11 and nothing else
